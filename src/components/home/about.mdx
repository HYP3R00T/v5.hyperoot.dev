<h2 class="text-text-secondary w-full text-center">About Me</h2>

I'm a DevOps Engineer, Python Developer, and Open-Source Contributor passionate about automation, cloud infrastructure, and developer tooling. I love building and maintaining Python packages, automating workflows with **GitHub Actions**, and managing infrastructure with **Ansible**.

I’m currently running my own [homelab](https://homelab.hyperoot.dev/) on an old HP Notebook 15-ay563tu, where I’ve set up a **single-node Kubernetes cluster** using **k3s**. I manage deployments with **FluxCD (GitOps)** and use **Traefik** for ingress management. This setup allows me to experiment with container orchestration and automation in a self-hosted environment.

Beyond DevOps, I focus on developer experience and documentation. I’ve built my own documentation generator, [CelestialDocs](https://celestialdocs.hyperoot.dev/), using **Astro**, and I use **MkDocs + GitHub Actions** to document many of my Python tools. I’ve also published multiple Python packages to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/user/HYP3R00T/), created a VSCode extension ([Settings Organizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hyperoot.settings-organizer)), and actively maintain my [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.hyperoot.dev/) with Ansible to streamline my workflow.

I strongly believe in open-source, learning in public, and sharing knowledge, which is why I blog at [hyperoot.dev](https://hyperoot.dev) and publish my personal notes at [rosetta.hyperoot.dev](https://rosetta.hyperoot.dev).
