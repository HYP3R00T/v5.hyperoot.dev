Sometimes while I start with a new project, I end up playing around with different external packages which I don't keep track of. To list all the pip packages, we can use `pip list` in the terminal. But it won't generate a `requirements.txt` file. We can use `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to generate it but it also contains the fixed version of the packages. I don't want that. So, here is a simple way to generate `requirements.txt` file that contains only the package name.

First install `setuptools` using `pip install setuptools`

```python
import pkg_resources

with open('requirements.txt', 'w') as file:
    for package in pkg_resources.working_set:
        file.write(package.project_name + '\n')
```

Save the file and execute it. And it's done. We now have a `requirements.txt` that contains the list of every packages that I installed.
