## 5. Code Blocks

Inline code is written like `console.log("Hello, world!");`

// A simple JavaScript function
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, Markdown!");
}
greet();
```

## 6. Tables

Below is a sample table:

|---------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Header**    | `# Header`             | Main titles                          |
| *Emphasis*    | `*italic*`             | Italicized text                      |
| **Lists**     | `- item` or `1. item`   | Unordered and ordered list items     |
| **Code Block**| ```` ```code``` ````   | For displaying code snippets         |

## 7. Blockquotes and Horizontal Lines
