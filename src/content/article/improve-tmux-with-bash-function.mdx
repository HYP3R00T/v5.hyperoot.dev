Are you tired of juggling multiple terminal windows and tabs just to keep your work organized? Enter `tmux`, a powerful terminal multiplexer that can revolutionize the way you work in the command line.

To make the most of `tmux`, consider integrating it into your workflow with a simple yet effective script like the one below:

```sh
# file -> .zshrc
function tnew() {
    local parent_name="$(basename "$(dirname "$(pwd)")"| tr -d "[:space:]-")"
    local current_name="$(basename "$(pwd)" | tr -d "[:space:]-")"
    local session_name="${parent_name}_${current_name}"

    if tmux has-session -t "$session_name" 2>/dev/null; then
        tmux attach-session -t "$session_name"
    else
        tmux new-session -s "$session_name"
    fi
}

alias tm='tnew'
```

Let's break down what this script does:

- It defines a function `tnew()` which creates a new `tmux` session based on the current directory name. This ensures that each project or task you're working on gets its own dedicated `tmux` session.
- The session_name is constructed using the names of the parent and current directories, removing any spaces or hyphens. This helps maintain a clean and consistent naming convention for your `tmux` sessions.
- If a session with the same name already exists, the script attaches to it. Otherwise, it creates a new session.

To use this script, simply add it to your shell configuration file (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`) and reload your shell. Now, instead of manually managing `tmux` sessions, you can simply type `tm` in your terminal to create or attach to a session based on your current directory.

With this streamlined workflow, you can say goodbye to terminal clutter and focus on what really matters â€“ getting things done. Give it a try and experience the power of `tmux` sessions firsthand!
