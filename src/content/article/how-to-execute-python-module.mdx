## Execute python script in terminal

A basic python looks something like the following.

```python
# file: sample.py
print("Hello World!!!")
```

`python sample.py` is a command that tells the Python interpreter to execute a Python script named `sample.py`.

Here's what each part means:

- `python`: This is the command used to run the Python interpreter.
- `sample.py`: This is the name of the Python script file you want to execute. In this case, it's named `sample.py`.
- When you run `python sample.py` in your command-line interface (CLI), the Python interpreter will execute the code contained within the `sample.py` file. This allows you to run Python scripts from the command line or terminal.

## Execute python project in terminal

A sample project will look something like the following.

```text
pwd
/path/to/project/

tree
.
├── README.md
├── sample_project
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── __main__.py
```

To trigger this `sample_project`, we can simply pass it as a parameter to python command.

```sh
# path: /path/to/project/
python sample_project
```

When the above command is triggered, python interpreter will look inside the `sample_project` folder and search for `__main__.py` file. the Python interpreter will execute the code contained within the `__main__.py` file.

This is called as **Python package with an executable module**

### Advantages

- **Modularity**: By organizing your code into a package with a `__main__.py` file, you can break down your project into smaller, more manageable modules. Each module can focus on specific functionality, making your codebase easier to understand, maintain, and reuse.
- **Reusability**: Packages can be reused across different projects or within the same project. You can import modules from your package into other scripts or projects, enabling code reuse without duplicating functionality.
- **Testability**: Modular code is typically easier to test than monolithic scripts. With a package structure, you can write unit tests for individual modules or subpackages, allowing for more comprehensive testing of your codebase.
- **Scalability**: As your project grows in complexity, a package-based structure provides scalability. You can easily add new modules or subpackages without cluttering a single script, making it easier to manage larger projects over time.
- **Entry Points**: Using a `__main__.py` file allows your package to define entry points for execution. This can be useful for command-line tools or applications where you want users to interact with your package as a standalone program.
