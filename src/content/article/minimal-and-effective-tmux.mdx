## Configuring Tmux and Using `.tmux.conf`

**Tmux** is a terminal multiplexer that allows you to manage multiple terminal sessions from a single window. You can create, navigate, split, and close panes and windows easily. Configuring Tmux with a `.tmux.conf` file enhances its usability by customizing key bindings, appearance, and behavior.

### Installing Tmux

To install Tmux, use the following command:

- On Ubuntu/Debian:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install tmux
  ```

- On macOS (using Homebrew):

  ```bash
  brew install tmux
  ```

### Creating and Editing `.tmux.conf`

The `.tmux.conf` file is where you configure Tmux. This file should be located in your home directory:

```bash
nano ~/.tmux.conf
```

You can add custom settings, key bindings, and design tweaks to this file. Once you've made changes, reload the configuration using the command:

```bash
tmux source-file ~/.tmux.conf
```

### Basic Configuration Example

Here’s a minimal `.tmux.conf` file:

```bash
# Set the prefix key to Ctrl + a
set -g prefix C-a
unbind C-b
bind C-a send-prefix

# Enable mouse support
set -g mouse on

# Split panes vertically and horizontally using | and -
bind | split-window -h
bind - split-window -v

# Switch panes with Alt + arrow keys
bind -n M-Left select-pane -L
bind -n M-Right select-pane -R
bind -n M-Up select-pane -U
bind -n M-Down select-pane -D
```

### Starting and Using Tmux

To start Tmux, simply type:

```bash
tmux
```

Once inside a Tmux session, you can split panes, create new windows, and navigate between them using your configured key bindings.

### Explanation of the Given `.tmux.conf`

This configuration file provides several customizations. Let’s break it down:

1. **Remap Prefix Key:**

   ```bash
   unbind C-b
   set-option -g prefix C-a
   bind-key C-a send-prefix
   ```

   - The default prefix key in Tmux is `Ctrl + b`. This remaps it to `Ctrl + a`, making it easier to access.

2. **Split Panes:**

   ```bash
   unbind '"'
   bind | split-window -h -c "#{pane_current_path}"
   unbind %
   bind - split-window -v -c "#{pane_current_path}"
   ```

   - The key bindings are remapped so that `|` splits the pane horizontally and `-` splits it vertically. The `-c "#{pane_current_path}"` ensures that the new pane starts in the same directory as the current one.

3. **Mouse Control:**

   ```bash
   set -g mouse on
   ```

   - This enables mouse support, allowing you to click and drag to resize panes or switch windows.

4. **Reload Configuration:**

   ```bash
   bind r source-file ~/.tmux.conf
   ```

   - Press `Prefix + r` to reload the `.tmux.conf` file without restarting Tmux.

5. **Switch Panes with Alt + Arrow Keys:**

   ```bash
   bind -n M-Left select-pane -L
   bind -n M-Right select-pane -R
   bind -n M-Up select-pane -U
   bind -n M-Down select-pane -D
   ```

   - These bindings allow you to move between panes using the Alt key combined with arrow keys, without needing the prefix key.

6. **Move Between Windows with Ctrl + Alt + Arrow Keys:**

   ```bash
   bind -n C-M-Left previous-window
   bind -n C-M-Right next-window
   ```

   - You can switch between windows using `Ctrl + Alt + Left/Right Arrow`.

7. **Window Management:**

   ```bash
   set-option -g allow-rename off
   bind c new-window -c "#{pane_current_path}"
   ```

   - The configuration disables automatic window renaming and allows you to create new windows in the current pane's directory.

8. **Design Tweaks:**
   - **Bell Configuration:**

     ```bash
     set -g visual-activity off
     set -g bell-action none
     ```

     - Disables visual or auditory notifications when a "bell" event occurs.
   - **Clock Mode:**

     ```bash
     setw -g clock-mode-colour colour1
     ```

     - Sets the clock mode color to a specific value (`colour1`).
   - **Pane Borders and Status Bar:**

     ```bash
     set -g pane-border-style 'fg=colour0'
     set -g pane-active-border-style 'fg=colour12'
     set -g status-position bottom
     set -g status-style 'fg=colour12'
     setw -g window-status-current-style 'fg=colour12 bold'
     ```

     - These settings customize the appearance of pane borders, the status bar, and window status. For example, the active pane border color is set to `colour12`.

## Streamlining Tmux Sessions

Managing multiple Tmux sessions and windows can be cumbersome, especially if you frequently switch between directories. By adding a custom function to your `.zshrc` file, you can simplify this process and enhance your workflow. In this post, we'll show you how to create a powerful Tmux session manager using Zsh.

### Introduction

Tmux is a versatile terminal multiplexer that allows you to manage multiple terminal sessions within a single window. However, if you often find yourself creating and switching between Tmux sessions and windows, a bit of automation can go a long way. This is where customizing your `.zshrc` file with a function for handling Tmux sessions can be incredibly useful.

### The Script

Here's a Zsh function that automates the process of creating or attaching to a Tmux session. This script checks if a Tmux session already exists; if it does, it will either switch to an existing window or create a new one based on your current directory. If no session exists, it creates a new one.

```zsh
# A better way to handle tmux sessions
function tnew() {
    local parent_name="$(basename "$(dirname "$(pwd)")" | tr -d "[:space:]-")"
    local current_name="$(basename "$(pwd)" | tr -d "[:space:]-")"
    local session_name="Hyperspace"
    local window_name="${current_name}"

    # Check if any tmux session exists
    if tmux list-sessions 2>/dev/null | grep -q "^"; then
        # Check if a window for the current directory already exists
        if tmux list-windows -t "$(tmux display-message -p '#S')" | grep -q "${window_name}"; then
            # If the window exists, switch to it
            tmux select-window -t "$window_name"
        else
            # If the window doesn't exist, create a new one
            tmux new-window -n "$window_name" -c "$(pwd)"
            tmux select-window -t "$window_name"
        fi
        tmux attach-session -t "$(tmux display-message -p '#S')"
    else
        # No existing session, create a new one and attach to it
        tmux new-session -s "$session_name" -n "$window_name" -c "$(pwd)"
    fi
}

# Aliases
alias tm='tnew'
```

### How It Works

1. **Function Definition:**

   ```zsh
   function tnew() {
       # Code here
   }
   ```

   - The `tnew` function is defined to manage Tmux sessions.

2. **Session and Window Naming:**

   ```zsh
   local parent_name="$(basename "$(dirname "$(pwd)")" | tr -d "[:space:]-")"
   local current_name="$(basename "$(pwd)" | tr -d "[:space:]-")"
   local session_name="Hyperspace"
   local window_name="${current_name}"
   ```

   - `parent_name` and `current_name` are derived from the current working directory. The function uses these names to keep your Tmux sessions and windows organized.

3. **Session Handling:**

   ```zsh
   if tmux list-sessions 2>/dev/null | grep -q "^"; then
       # Existing session handling
   else
       # No session, create a new one
   fi
   ```

   - If Tmux sessions exist, the script checks for a window corresponding to the current directory. It switches to the window if it exists or creates a new one if it doesn’t. If no session is found, a new session is created and attached.

4. **Alias Definition:**

   ```zsh
   alias tm='tnew'
   ```

   - The `tm` alias is created to call the `tnew` function easily. Instead of typing out the entire function name, you can simply use `tm` to manage your Tmux sessions.

### Setting Up

1. **Add the Function to `.zshrc`:**
   - Open your `.zshrc` file:

     ```zsh
     nano ~/.zshrc
     ```

   - Add the `tnew` function and alias to the file.

2. **Apply Changes:**
   - After editing `.zshrc`, reload it to apply the changes:

     ```zsh
     source ~/.zshrc
     ```

3. **Use the Alias:**
   - In your terminal, type `tm` to create or attach to a Tmux session based on your current directory.

### Conclusion

By integrating this script into your `.zshrc` file, you can greatly simplify the process of managing Tmux sessions and windows. It provides a seamless way to handle your terminal environments, allowing you to focus more on your work and less on session management. Give it a try and see how it enhances your productivity!
